@file: backend/agents/nodes/anonymize.py
@description: Selects representative quotes per theme and anonymizes them. Picks quotes
    by diversity (nearest to centroid, plus the most and least severe) so the digest
    shows range rather than three phrasings of the same complaint. Anything the
    anonymizer was unsure about is preserved as [POSSIBLE-NAME] and surfaced for review.
@flow: run() -> for each theme select up to N candidate conversations -> anonymize each
    quote (regex then LLM) -> store on Theme.representative_quotes with its redaction
    list and needs_review flag -> count how many need human eyes.
@dependencies:
    - backend.services.anonymizer.Anonymizer: the two-pass redactor
    - backend.services.vector_store.cosine_similarity: centroid-proximity selection
