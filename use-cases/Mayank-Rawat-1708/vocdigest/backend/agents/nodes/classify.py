@file: backend/agents/nodes/classify.py
@description: Decides which ingested rows are genuine support conversations and which
    are noise (marketing blasts, autoresponders, empty pings). Also the first place
    prompt-injection attempts surface: content that tries to address the model is
    flagged, counted, and kept as data rather than obeyed or silently dropped.
@flow: run() -> batch unclassified conversations -> one LLM call per batch, content
    fenced inside <document> tags -> parse per-row verdicts -> write classified_type,
    is_relevant, injection_flagged -> irrelevant rows stay in the DB so the digest can
    report honestly how many inputs were excluded and why.
@dependencies:
    - backend.services.groq_client.GroqClient: batched classification
    - backend.models.Conversation: rows updated in place
