@file: backend/agents/graph.py
@description: Assembles the nine nodes into a LangGraph StateGraph and provides the two
    entry points the API uses: start_run (fresh) and resume_run (after a pause, a crash,
    or an approval decision). Because every node checkpoints and skips itself when
    already complete, both entry points run the same graph — resume is not a separate
    code path, which is what keeps the two from drifting apart.
@flow: build_graph() wires ingest -> classify -> extract -> theme -> anonymize ->
    compare -> draft -> human_gate -> superdocs -> END. execute_run() loads or creates
    the run row, rehydrates state from the checkpoint, invokes the graph, and translates
    a NodePause into a normal return rather than an exception.
@dependencies:
    - langgraph.graph.StateGraph: orchestration
    - backend.agents.nodes.*: the nine stage implementations
