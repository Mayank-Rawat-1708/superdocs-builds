@file: backend/agents/state.py
@description: The state object threaded through every node of the digest graph. Kept
    deliberately small and JSON-serialisable: bulk data (conversation text, embeddings,
    theme rows) lives in Postgres and is referenced by run_id, so a checkpoint write is
    cheap and a resumed run rehydrates from the database rather than from a fat blob.
@flow: build_initial_state() at run start -> each node reads what it needs, writes its
    summary fields, and returns the mutated dict -> LangGraph carries it forward ->
    serialised into runs.checkpoint_data at each stage boundary.
@dependencies:
    - typing.TypedDict: LangGraph's expected state shape
